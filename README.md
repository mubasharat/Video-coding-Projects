# Video Coding Projects

This repository contains coursework and practical exercises for the Video Coding,Video System Technology, and Image & Video Perception modules in the M.Sc. Media Technology program.  
All implementations are provided as Jupyter notebooks and focus on understanding and applying core concepts in digital image and video processing.

## Repository Structure

- `task_sheet_01.ipynb`  
  Introductory exercises on fundamental image and video processing concepts. Typical topics include:
  - Basic image representation (pixels, color spaces, resolutions)
  - Simple spatial operations (e.g., brightness/contrast adjustment, filtering)
  - Reading, displaying, and saving images and video frames

- `task_sheet_02.ipynb`  
  Focus on transform-based image/video processing and compression basics, such as:
  - Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and/or other transforms
  - Quantization and reconstruction effects
  - Simple block-based processing and visualization of compression artifacts

- `task_sheet_03.ipynb`  
  Exercises on motion estimation and compensation, including:
  - Block matching between video frames
  - Motion vector fields
  - Motion-compensated prediction and residual analysis

- `task_sheet_04.ipynb`  
  Higher-level video coding and analysis tasks, for example:
  - Rate–distortion trade-offs
  - More advanced prediction / filtering concepts
  - Evaluating coding performance with objective metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM)

> Note: The exact content of each notebook follows the respective task sheets from the course; the descriptions above summarize the typical topics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Common scientific Python stack:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - (Optionally) `opencv-python` and other libraries if required by specific tasks


## Learning Objectives

Across the four task sheets, you will:

- Understand the basics of digital images and video signals.
- Apply spatial and transform-domain operations to images and video.
- Implement and visualize motion estimation and compensation.
- Explore video coding principles, including compression, prediction, and quality metrics.

These notebooks are intended as **learning and experimentation tools** rather than production-ready code.
